# Algorithms, Data Structures, Challenge solutions

This is a repository where I am dumping anything I write (or copy from tutorials) that relates to
these more theoretical application concepts (ie. not typical to day-to-day coding)

## Using these locally

`python3 {script}.py`

OR _(only on \*nix systems)_

```
sh make_executable.sh
./path/to/script/{script}.py
```

# Binary Search Tree Big O Notation

| Algorithm | Average  | Worst Case |
| --------- | -------- | ---------- |
| Space     | O(n)     | O(n)       |
| Search    | O(log n) | O(n)       |
| Insert    | O(log n) | O(n)       |
| Delete    | O(log n) | O(n)       |

## Protips

If a question comes up mentioning a sorted input, heavily consider using binary search for the solution.
